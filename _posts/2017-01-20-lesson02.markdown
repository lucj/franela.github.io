## Let's play with Docker containers !

## What you will do

In this first lab, you’ll put in practice the base commands to manage Docker containers.
You’ll then start to play and hopefully to have fun with containers.

## Check the version

```.term
docker version
```

You should be running 1.13 for client and server, correct ?

## Launch containers

## Launch a container based on alpine in interactive mode

```.term
docker container run -ti alpine
```

Provide "sh" command when launching the container
```.term
docker container run -ti alpine sh
```

Launch a container based on mongo image. What is happening ?
Exit the container without killing PID 1 (C-P / C-Q)
Attach to the mongo container
Inspect container
Launch a container based on nginx in background mode
Inspect the container
Find the following parameters (Hostname, Adresse IP)


## Next Steps
For the next step in the tutorial, head over to [1.0 Running an alpine container](../alpine)`
